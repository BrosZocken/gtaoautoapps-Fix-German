This is automated script (AHK, v1.1 for now) for using apartments trade-in exploit in GTA Online.

For this to work, you need:
1. GTA5 E&E (Enhanced&Expanded) version of the game (ATM it DOESN'T WORK on Legacy Edition),
2. Game set in 1024x768 windowed mode,
3. Game's language set in English.
4. Safezone size set on 7 ticks (Settings tab, then Display tab; easiest way to set this right - set it on max to the right, then tap left three times).
5. Phone alerts on "OFF" and Message Frequency set on 1 hour (Settings, Notifications tab).
6. Frame Limit set on 60 fps and Pause Game on Focus Loss set on "OFF" (Settings, Graphics tab).
7. "Snapmatic Quick launch" set to "OFF" (Pull up Phone while in GTA Online, keep pressing right arrow on keyboard until you will get "settings" tile, enter it, then enter "Snapmatic" and choose "Snapmatic quick launch off").
8. Change Spawn Location to any building except Apartments, Garages and entity packed location like LS Car Meet (exemples: Hanger, Facility, Kostaka, Auto Shop)


**Installation:**
-
1. Download .zip and extrakt it (you have to install AutoHotKey v1.1 to use the script)
or
2. Download .exe not need to install anything **(hotkeys can not be changend for now in .exe)**

**IMPORTANT**
-
The Script will ask for admin rights.
The script wont run without admin rights. It needs them to add and remove firewall rules used for NoSave, without admin it cant do that and NoSave will not work.


**Controls:**
-
**Numpad0**: PREPRATION PHASE
- This is for setting up all 10 slots to $550k value on each. You HAVE TO run it in Story Mode. You run it and wait until completion.


**Numpad1**: PAYBACK PHASE
- This is the main hotkey. You use it for "selling apartments" (when all slots are set). You HAVE TO run this hotkey when in Story mode.
Window with input box will appear. You enter how many runs you want to attempt and then just wait until it will be complete.

**Numpad2**: No-Save enable "panic button"
- You can use this to enable nosave manually.

**Numpad3**: No-Save disable "panic button"
- You can use this to disable nosave manually.

**Numpad4**: Reload "panic button"
